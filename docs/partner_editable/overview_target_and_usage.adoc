The Sitecore Experience Platform (XP) is a content management system (CMS) for web
content that automates marketing to deliver a personalized user experience. This Quick
Start is intended for organizations that want to deploy a multirole Sitecore XP 9.3
architecture on the AWS Cloud.
This Quick Start provides step-by-step instructions to deploy 12 roles that compose the
complete Sitecore XP platform. All of the roles are deployed into individual Auto Scaling
groups to ensure recoverability when an instance fails. Database services are provided by
SQL Server through Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), and caching is
managed by Redis on Amazon ElastiCache.
To control access, this deployment uses AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) and AWS Secrets
Manager. Other services used by this Quick Start include Amazon Simple Storage Service
(Amazon S3), AWS Systems Manager, Amazon CloudWatch, AWS Lambda, and Amazon
Route 53.
