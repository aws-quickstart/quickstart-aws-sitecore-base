== FAQ

*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, we recommend that you relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *No*. (This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console, *Options* page.) With this setting, the stack’s state is retained and the instance is left running, so you can troubleshoot the issue. (For Windows, look at the log files in %ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService and C:\cfn\log.)
// If you’re deploying on Linux instances, provide the location for log files on Linux, or omit this sentence.

WARNING: When you set *Rollback on failure* to *Disabled*, you continue to incur AWS charges for this stack. Please make sure to delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting.

For additional information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation^] on the AWS website.

*Q.* I encountered a size limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* We recommend that you launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a location other than an S3 bucket, you might encounter template size limitations. For more information about AWS CloudFormation quotas, see the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS documentation^].

*Q.* When browsing the content-delivery website, I get a *504* error.

*A.* This issue is experienced if the content-delivery or content-management server takes
more than 60 seconds to respond to an Application Load Balancer request. Ensure that the
Sitecore role has the IIS Application Pool configured to remain running. Based on the
complexity of your website, responses from the database and other roles can also affect
response time. Ensure that the database and instances are sized correctly for your
environment.

Using browser caching or a content delivery network can also assist the caching of common
content and therefore reduce the load on the Sitecore environment.

*Q.* When I try to log in to the Sitecore administrator interface, I get an *incorrect password* error.

*A.* Despite installation logs that show the password was correctly configured, there are
known issues where the specified Sitecore administrator password in AWS Secrets Manager
is not successfully applied. To log in, you must reset the password in the Sitecore Core
database.

*Q.* How do I update SSL certificates when they expire?

*A.* Please see the <<_other_useful_information,Other useful information>> section for guidance about updating internal
Sitecore certificates.

*Q.* Where are the deployment logs?

*A.* All resources and logs for deployments are found either in Amazon CloudWatch Logs or
in the instances themselves under `C:\resources\logs\`.

*Q.* How do I apply a new license?

*A.* When a Sitecore license expires, manually update it for each instance by copying your
Sitecore `license.xml` file to the `/site/wwwroot/App_Data` directory. But, if an Auto Scaling
group creates a new instance, it attempts to retrieve the Sitecore license from the S3 bucket
and prefix provided in the initial deployment. Therefore, it’s necessary to replace the
existing license by uploading a new Sitecore license into the S3 bucket and prefix.
