The Sitecore XP workloads are deployed on multiple Amazon EC2 instances for improved
performance. The content-delivery and content-management roles can be scaled for high
availability. Other Sitecore roles have restrictions on active/active roles and are designed
for active/passive standby. Due to this, other Sitecore roles belong to their own Auto
Scaling groups as single instances. Should an instance become unavailable, itâ€™s replaced by
a new instance and configured with a Sitecore role of the same type.

Website content can be deployed to the content-delivery and content-management roles
using your choice of deployment software. User data for private and shared sessions is
configured on the content-delivery instances to be stored within Redis in Amazon
ElastiCache.
