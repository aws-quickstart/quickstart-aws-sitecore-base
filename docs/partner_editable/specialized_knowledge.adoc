This Quick Start assumes familiarity with PowerShell, Apache Solr, and _{partner-product-name}_ roles
and configurations. It also requires a moderate level of familiarity with AWS services. If
you’re new to AWS, visit the https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/[Getting Started Resource Center] and the https://aws.amazon.com/training/[AWS Training and
Certification website]. These sites provide materials for learning how to design, deploy, and
operate your infrastructure and applications on the AWS Cloud.

In some scenarios you may want to deploy Sitecore into an existing VPC, which has a selfmanaged DNS rather than a Route 53–connected hosted zone. When deploying this Quick
Start into an existing VPC, set `VPCPrivateDNS` to *true*. Then create DNS Canonical Name
Record (CNAME) entries in your self-managed DNS. For more information, see Step 
<<_post_deployment_steps,Post-deployment steps>>.
